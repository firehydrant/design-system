# installation

The package is registered on GitHub's package registry, added via `.npmrc`

Access to this registry requires authentication with GitHub tokens. These tokens are private and should not be committed to any project, accessed instead via environment variable.

### GitHub token as environment variable

1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens and create a token with at least `read:package` access

2. Set the token (paste into either `~/.zshrc` OR `~/.bashrc`)

   ```sh
   export GITHUB_TOKEN=<your token>
   ```

3. Open a new terminal window (or `source` the edited `.*rc` file)

### Include GitHub package registry

1. Add .npmrc file to your project

   ```sh
   cd path/to/your/project && touch .npmrc
   ```

2. Paste the following into `.npmrc` (do not edit)
   ```sh
   //npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=${GITHUB_TOKEN}
   @firehydrant:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
   ```

### Add to project

```sh
yarn add @firehydrant/design-system
```

_or_

```sh
npm i @firehydrant/design-system --save
```

# usage

Our components require a `ThemeProvider` to wrap your application. By default the FireHydrant theme is included with our provider.

```jsx
// import themeprovider from our package
import { ThemeProvider } from '@firehydrant/design-system';

// wrap your application
<ThemeProvider>
  <App />
</ThemeProvider>;
```
