# Pull Requests

Work is done on branch names generated by Clubhouse (e.g. `<username>/<ch####>/<ticket-name>`).

Pull Requests should target `main` and be squash-merged.

2. Obtain branch name via [Git Helper](https://help.clubhouse.io/hc/en-us/articles/207540323-Using-Branches-and-Pull-Requests-with-the-Clubhouse-VCS-Integrations)
3. Push to designated branch

# Deploy

In addition to a semantic versioned package, this project also deploys two web applications automatically:

[![Storybook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/storybooks/brand/master/badge/badge-storybook.svg)][storybook]
[![Playroom](https://img.shields.io/badge/playroom-live-000)][playroom]

## [Storybook][storybook]

On push, every branch is configured to automatically build & deploy to [Chromatic][chromatic] via ["Chromatic" GitHub Workflow](./.github/workflows/chromatic.yml).

## [Playroom][playroom]

On push to `main`, Playroom will be automatically built to a `docs/` folder, pushed to `gh-pages` branch, and deployed to GitHub Pages via ["Build & Deploy Playroom" GitHub Workflow](./.github/workflows/playroom.yml).
